# High-Fidelity Image Upscaling Pipeline

This **README** details a comprehensive, domain-specific pipeline for upscaling images using deep-learning methods on an **RTX 3090** (or similar high-end GPU). It covers four image types:

1. **Real Photos** (Smartphone JPEGs)  
2. **AI-Generated Anime** (e.g., FLUX.1-dev outputs)  
3. **Stable Diffusion–Generated Anime**  
4. **Digital Artwork** (Human-made)

The priority is **visual quality** and **artifact reduction**, not speed. All steps can run on the GPU via frameworks like **PyTorch**.

## Overview of the Workflow

1. **(Optional) Preprocessing**  
   - Color/exposure corrections, lens distortion fixes (for real photos).  
   - Removal of compression artifacts or noise.

2. **Upscaling**  
   - Use a **domain-specific** super-resolution model (e.g., Real-ESRGAN, Waifu2x, SwinIR).  
   - Typically upscale by **2× or 4×** for best balance of quality vs. artifacts.

3. **(Optional) Post-Processing**  
   - Mild sharpening or smoothing to correct oversharpening halos.  
   - Final color grading or blending, if needed.

4. **Export**  
   - Save in a high-quality format (PNG, TIFF, or high-quality JPEG/WebP).

## Pipeline Steps in Detail

### 1. Preprocessing (Optional)

- **Color & Exposure Correction**  
  - If images are too dark/bright or have color casts, adjust them with GPU-accelerated tools (OpenCV CUDA or a PyTorch-based pipeline).
- **Lens Distortion / Perspective Correction**  
  - Relevant mostly for real photos from smartphones. Minimizes geometric distortions.
- **Denoising / Artifact Removal**  
  - **MPRNet**, **SwinIR (denoising)**, or simpler models like **DnCNN** or **FFDNet** for mild cases.  
  - Removes noise so the super-resolution model doesn’t upscale it as “detail.”

### 2. Primary Upscaling

- **Choose a Model**  
  - **Real-ESRGAN** for real-world photos or light cartoons.  
  - **ESRGAN Anime** / **Waifu2x** for anime/line art.  
  - **SwinIR** (real-image or denoising variant) for state-of-the-art performance (at a higher computational cost).
- **Scale Factor**  
  - Typically 2× or 4× in a single pass.  
  - If extremely large output is needed, consider multiple passes (e.g., 2× then another 2×).

### 3. Post-Processing (Optional)

- **Artifact Reduction**  
  - If the SR model introduces “GAN swirlies,” ringing, or halo artifacts, apply a **mild bilateral filter** or **median filter**.  
- **Sharpening**  
  - If edges are slightly soft, a mild unsharp mask helps, but be careful not to oversharpen.
- **Color Grading / Level Adjustments**  
  - If needed, unify the final look of your upscaled image.

### 4. Export

- **Preferred Formats**  
  - **PNG** or **TIFF** for lossless quality.  
  - **JPEG/WebP** at high quality if file size is a concern.
- **File Names & Metadata**  
  - Consider embedding a tag or suffix to indicate new resolution or pipeline version.

## Domain-Specific Recommendations

### 1. Real Photos (Smartphone JPEGs)

1. **Preprocess**
   - **Optional**: Fix exposure, white balance, or lens distortion if images come from iPhone 13 / Pixel 7.  
   - **Denoise**: Use a robust model like **MPRNet** or **SwinIR denoising** if the image is noisy or has compression artifacts.

2. **Upscale**
   - **Real-ESRGAN** is the easiest all-in-one solution for real-world photos.  
   - **SwinIR (Real-Image SR)** can yield higher fidelity if you don’t mind slower processing.

3. **Post-Processing**
   - Check for oversharpening or “GAN swirlies.” Apply a light smoothing filter if artifacts appear.  
   - Optionally color grade or adjust contrast.

4. **Export**
   - Save as PNG or high-quality JPEG.

### 2. Anime (Generated by FLUX.1-dev)

1. **Preprocess**
   - If there’s minimal noise, you can skip heavy denoising.  
   - Otherwise, a simple **DnCNN** or **FFDNet** pass can remove artifact blocks.

2. **Upscale**
   - **Waifu2x** or **Real-ESRGAN (anime variant)**:  
     - E.g., `RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B` or a specialized ESRGAN model like `4x-AnimeSharp`.
   - Typically upscale by 2×–4× for best results.

3. **Post-Processing**
   - Check lines remain crisp and colors remain flat.  
   - A mild smoothing filter if lines become jagged or too pixel-precise.

4. **Export**
   - Use PNG (lossless) to keep line art and color blocks clean.

---

### 3. Anime (Generated by Stable Diffusion)

1. **Preprocess**
   - Look for “latent swirlies” or banding that might appear in backgrounds.  
   - If present, do a quick pass with **DnCNN** / **FFDNet** or run it through a **Stable Diffusion img2img** with low denoising strength for mild refinement.

2. **Upscale**
   - **Waifu2x**, **Real-ESRGAN (anime)**, or a **Stable Diffusion upscaler** approach (latent upscaling).  
   - Latent upscaling can introduce new details but might alter the style slightly.

3. **Post-Processing**
   - If more advanced AI artifacts appear, lightly smooth them out with a bilateral filter.  
   - Check line clarity and color consistency.

4. **Export**
   - Again, PNG for best color & line preservation.

---

### 4. Digital Artwork (Human-Made)

Digital art can be painterly, comic-style, or anywhere in between:

1. **Preprocess**
   - If it’s lightly compressed or noise-free, skip heavy denoising.  
   - For older or heavily compressed artwork, a pass with **DnCNN** or **MPRNet** can help.

2. **Upscale**
   - **Line Art / Comics**: Similar to anime → Waifu2x or ESRGAN anime.  
   - **Painterly / Semi-Realistic**: **SwinIR** or **Real-ESRGAN** (general model) often handles brush textures better.

3. **Post-Processing**
   - Mild sharpening if brush strokes seem too soft.  
   - Optional style tweaks in a paint program if needed.

4. **Export**
   - PNG, TIFF, or high-quality JPEG based on your final usage.

## Practical Implementation Notes

1. **GPU Acceleration**
   - Most models (ESRGAN, Waifu2x, SwinIR, MPRNet) have **PyTorch** implementations. Run with `--device cuda`.
2. **Batch vs. Single Image**
   - For maximum quality, process images one at a time or in small batches.  
   - The **RTX 3090** has 24 GB VRAM, which should handle higher resolutions or multiple images in parallel.
3. **Chaining Steps**
   - If images are severely degraded or extremely small, consider a two-pass approach:  
     1. **Denoise** → 2. **2× Upscale** → 3. **Denoise** (if necessary) → 4. **Another 2× Upscale**.
4. **Experimentation**
   - Different images respond differently. Always do side-by-side comparisons to pick the best pipeline for your style.

## Summary

By **matching each image type** (real-world photos, AI/anime, digital artwork) with **domain-specific SR models** and carefully **preprocessing** (denoising, artifact removal), you’ll achieve **maximum visual fidelity**. Then, refine with **post-processing** to ensure sharp lines (for anime/comics) or smooth textures (for photos/painterly art). Finally, **export** in a format that preserves the newly added details.

**Enjoy experimenting with your GPU-accelerated image processing!**
